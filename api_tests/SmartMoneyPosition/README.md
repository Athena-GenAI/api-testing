It looks like we need to add the required dependencies to the Lambda function. The error indicates that the idna module is missing, which is a dependency of the requests library. Let's create a requirements.txt file and update the deployment instructions.

To deploy the Lambda function properly:
Create a deployment package:
# Create a new directory for the deployment package
mkdir deployment-package
cd deployment-package

# Install dependencies into the package directory
pip install -r requirements.txt -t .

# Copy your Lambda function code
cp ATH-GetSmartMoneyPosition.py .

# Create zip file
zip -r ../lambda_deployment.zip .

Update the Lambda function configuration:
Memory: At least 1024MB
Timeout: At least 8:30 seconds to handle API calls
Python runtime: Python 3.13 or later
Make sure the Lambda function has the proper IAM role with permissions:

Upload the deployment package:
Use the AWS Console or AWS CLI to upload the zip file
If using AWS CLI:

aws lambda update-function-code --function-name YOUR_FUNCTION_NAME --zip-file fileb://lambda_deployment.zip

This function is set to refresh every hour.
